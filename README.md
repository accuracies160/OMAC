Members: Marcus, Luis, Andrew, Haider, Courtney

## Introduction
	### Project OMAC is designed to help build a community for disaster awareness
	### Users can keep track of disasters that affect their friends and family
	### Also allows users to find disaster relief centers
	### Stakeholders can work with businesses to help provide relief to those affected

## Key Features
        ### You can track all disasters throughout the country
        ### Favorite locations to receive updates on family and friends
        ### Community tab: this allows customers to provide help/resources for others and local businesses can provide discounts/benefits to those affected
        ### Users will be able to filter through types of disasters, location, most recent, and severe
        ### Also helps users see nearby evacuation zones

## User Roles & Experience
        ### Customers: these users will be allowed to view and interact with the site, set up favorite locations and friends
        ### Employees: Monitor the day-to-day health of the site, ensuring that there are few bugs and glitches. Making sure customer complaints are heard
        ### Business Customers: These users are special since they will be providing goods and services for regular customers.
        ### Admins: Deal with Business Customers and any escalated issues with customers

## Performance & Security
        ### Running off an established map API, speed should be only limited by developers servers
        ### Filtering only by specified location and scaleable size should not cause any performance issues
        ### Having users require password authentication, privacy and security of accounts
        ### During natural disasters, systems should be able to handle high traffic of users

## System Availability & Reliability
        ### Uptime expectations are to be 24/7 to track natural disasters non-stop
        ### Device compatibility: all smart devices with a web browser
        ### Service will be web-based to assist with wide device compatibility
        ### Potential third-party integrations: social media platforms to widen tracking across the internet or to highlight any important relief centers and integrate it within OMAC
## Customer Benefits
        ### Allows a single platform solely for natural disaster tracking without any unnecessary clutter
        ### OMAC app will be easy to navigate and easy to use for customers
        ### OMAC app has customer support to allow people to contact us when they need help
